WHAT HAPPENS IN MEMORY
function stores in the form of stacks in memory and along with it it contains its variable in it
and when the return statement is executed the function clears from the call stack



now call by reference and call by value 
like in swappign of variables is swap by value

in our swap example where we swap values in function 
remember the swap function print wil show the swapped 
values as in that function the copies of a and b is 
provided like when we pass an argument to a function 
those arguments are actually the copy of arguments 
premsent in main function so the swapped values will 
be only print in the function in which we have swapped
the values not in the main functionthis is what we call 
pass by value java k ander sare functions me call by value pass hota hai
